# The Lectic Conversation Format

Lectic conversations are stored in plain markdown files, typically with a
`.lec` extension. They use a superset of CommonMark, adding two specific
conventions: a YAML frontmatter block for configuration and "container
directives" for assistant responses.

## 1. YAML Frontmatter

Every Lectic file begins with a YAML frontmatter block, enclosed by three
dashes (`---`). This is where you configure the conversation, defining the
interlocutor(s), their models, prompts, and any tools they might use.

A minimal header looks like this:

```yaml
---
interlocutor:
  name: Assistant
  prompt: You are a helpful assistant.
  provider: anthropic
  model: claude-3-haiku-20240307
  # Optional thinking controls (Anthropic/Gemini):
  # thinking_budget: 1024     # integer token budget for reasoning
---
```

The frontmatter can be closed with either three dashes (`---`) or three
periods (`...`). For a complete guide to all available options, see the
Configuration page.

## 2. User Messages

Anything in the file that is not part of the YAML frontmatter or an
assistant response block is considered a user message. You write your
prompts, questions, and instructions here as plain text or standard
markdown.

```markdown
This is a user message.

So is this. You can include any markdown you like, such as **bold text** or
`inline code`.
```

## 3. Assistant Responses

Lectic uses "container directives" to represent messages from the LLM. These
are fenced blocks that start with a run of colons, followed immediately by
the name of the interlocutor.

The canonical form is exactly three colons on open and close, like this:

```markdown
:::Name

Some content.

:::
```

Markdown code fences inside assistant blocks can also use three backticks.

Inline attachments at the top
- Lectic may insert one or more inline attachment blocks at the very
  start of an assistant block. These are XML chunks beginning with
  `<inline-attachment ...>`. They are used to cache computed content
  from directives like `:cmd[...]`.
- When sending a request to the provider, these attachments are treated
  as if they were a user message that immediately precedes the
  assistant’s round.

### Example

Here is a complete, simple conversation file showing all the parts together:

````markdown
---
interlocutor:
  name: Oggle
  prompt: You are a skeptical assistant.
---

I'd like to know more about container directives.

:::Oggle

Are you sure? It seems like a rather niche topic. They are part of a
proposed extension to CommonMark that allows for custom block-level
elements.

Inside one of these blocks, standard markdown is still supported:

```python
# This is a regular code block
print("Hello from inside a directive!")
```

Is that all you wanted to know?

````

When you run `lectic`, it reads the entire file, sends the content to the
LLM, and then appends the next assistant response in a new directive block.
