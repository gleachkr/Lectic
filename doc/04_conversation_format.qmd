# The Lectic Conversation Format

Lectic conversations are stored in plain markdown files, typically with a
`.lec` extension. They use a superset of CommonMark, adding two specific
conventions: a YAML frontmatter block for configuration and "container
directives" for assistant responses.

## 1. YAML Frontmatter

Every Lectic file begins with a YAML frontmatter block, enclosed by three
dashes (`---`). This is where you configure the conversation, defining the
interlocutor(s), their models, prompts, and any tools they might use.

A minimal header looks like this:

```yaml
---
interlocutor:
  name: Assistant
  prompt: You are a helpful assistant.
  provider: anthropic
  model: claude-3-haiku-20240307
  # Optional thinking controls (Anthropic/Gemini):
  # thinking_budget: 1024     # integer token budget for reasoning
---
```

The frontmatter can be closed with either three dashes (`---`) or three
periods (`...`). For a complete guide to all available options, see the
Configuration page.

## 2. User Messages

Anything in the file that is not part of the YAML frontmatter or an
assistant response block is considered a user message. You write your
prompts, questions, and instructions here as plain text or standard
markdown.

```markdown
This is a user message.

So is this. You can include any markdown you like, such as **bold text** or
`inline code`.
```

## 3. Assistant Responses

Lectic uses "container directives" to represent messages from the LLM. These
are fenced blocks that start with a run of colons, followed immediately by
the name of the interlocutor.

The canonical form is exactly three colons on open and close, like this:

```markdown
:::Name

Some content.

:::
```

Markdown code fences inside assistant blocks can also use three backticks.

### Inline Attachments

When you use directives like `:cmd[...]` in your message, Lectic executes
them and caches the results as **inline attachments**. These within the
assistant's response block as XML chunks:

```xml
<inline-attachment cmd="git diff --staged" type="text">
┆diff --git a/src/main.ts b/src/main.ts
┆...
</inline-attachment>
```

Inline attachments serve two purposes:

1. **Caching**: The results are stored in the file, so re-running Lectic
   doesn't re-execute old commands. Only `:cmd` directives in the most
   recent user message are executed.

2. **Context positioning**: When sending the conversation to the provider,
   attachments are treated as if they were a user message This keeps provider
   caches stable and avoids token recomputation.

You'll see inline attachments frequently when using `:cmd`. They're part
of the conversation record and should generally be left alone. Editor
plugins typically fold them by default to reduce visual clutter.

### Example

Here is a complete, simple conversation file showing all the parts together:

````markdown
---
interlocutor:
  name: Oggle
  prompt: You are a skeptical assistant.
---

I'd like to know more about container directives.

:::Oggle

Are you sure? It seems like a rather niche topic. They are part of a
proposed extension to CommonMark that allows for custom block-level
elements.

Inside one of these blocks, standard markdown is still supported:

```python
# This is a regular code block
print("Hello from inside a directive!")
```

Is that all you wanted to know?

:::
````

When you run `lectic`, it reads the entire file, sends the content to the
LLM, and then appends the next assistant response in a new directive block.
