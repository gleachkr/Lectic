# Lectic Configuration

Lectic offers a flexible configuration system that lets you set global
defaults, create per-project settings, and make conversation-specific
overrides. This is managed through a hierarchy of YAML files.

## Configuration Hierarchy

Configuration settings are merged from multiple sources. Each source in the
list below overrides the one before it, with the `.lec` file's own header
always having the final say.

1.  **System Config Directory**: Lectic first looks for a configuration file at
    `lectic/lectic.yaml` within your system's standard config location
    (e.g., `~/.config/lectic/lectic.yaml` on Linux). This is the ideal
    place for your global, user-level defaults.

2.  **Workspace Config**: Next, Lectic looks for `lectic.yaml` by walking up
    from the active document directory (or from the current working directory
    when no file is active) until it finds one.

3.  **Lectic File Header**: The YAML frontmatter within your `.lec` file is
    the final and highest-precedence source of configuration.

## Imports (Modular Configuration)

You can split configuration across multiple files with top-level `imports`.
Each import can be either a string path or an object with `path` and
optional `optional: true`.

```yaml
imports:
  - ./.lectic/plugins/sales/module.yaml
  - path: ./.lectic/plugins/finance
    optional: true
```

Important details:

- Relative import paths are resolved from the file that declares them.
- If an import path is a directory, Lectic loads `<dir>/lectic.yaml`.
- Imports are recursive, so imported files can have their own `imports`.
- Import cycles are detected and reported as errors.

This is useful for plugin bundles, shared team defaults, and separating
large configs into smaller modules.

## Overriding Default Directories

You can change the default locations for Lectic's data directories by
setting the following environment variables:

- `$LECTIC_CONFIG`: Overrides the base configuration directory path.
- `$LECTIC_DATA`: Overrides the data directory path.
- `$LECTIC_CACHE`: Overrides the cache directory path.
- `$LECTIC_STATE`: Overrides the state directory path.

These variables, along with `$LECTIC_TEMP` (a temporary directory) and
`$LECTIC_FILE` (the path to the active `.lec` file), are automatically
passed into the environment of any subprocesses Lectic spawns, such as
`exec` tools. This ensures your custom scripts have access to the same
context as the main process.

## Merging Logic

When combining settings from multiple configuration files, Lectic follows
specific rules:

- **Objects (Mappings)**: If the higher precedence source has a `name`
  attribute, and the name doesn't match the `name` attribute of the lower
  precedence source, then the higher precedence source replaces the lower
  precedence source. Otherwise, the objects are combined and matching keys
  merged recursively.
- **Arrays (Lists)**: Merged based on the `name` attribute of their
  elements. If two objects in an array share the same `name`, they are
  merged. Otherwise, the elements are simply combined. This is especially
  useful for managing lists of tools and interlocutors. When duplicate
  named items appear within a single file, later entries override earlier
  ones. The LSP warns on duplicate names in the document header to help
  catch mistakes.
- **Other Values**: For simple values (strings, numbers) or if the types
  don't match, the value from the highest-precedence source is used without
  any merging.

Additionally, the LSP validates header fields. It reports errors for
missing or mistyped interlocutor properties and warns when you add
unknown properties to an interlocutor mapping, which helps catch typos
in keys like `model` or `max_tokens`.

### Example

Imagine you have a global config in `~/.config/lectic/lectic.yaml`:

```yaml
# ~/.config/lectic/lectic.yaml
interlocutors:
    - name: opus
      provider: anthropic
      model: claude-3-opus-20240229
```

And a project-specific file, `project.yaml`:

```yaml
# ./project.yaml
interlocutor:
    name: haiku
    model: claude-3-haiku-20240307
    tools:
        - exec: bash
        - agent: opus
```

If you place this project config at `./lectic.yaml` in your working
directory, Lectic will merge it with your system defaults and the
document header using the precedence above. The `haiku` interlocutor
will be configured with the `claude-3-haiku` model, and it will have
access to a `bash` tool and an `agent` tool that can call `opus`.
You can switch to `opus` within the conversation if needed, using an 
[`:ask[]` directive](./context_management/02_conversation_control.qmd).
