# Managing Context: External Content

Lectic aims to make it easy to pull external information into the conversation,
providing the LLM with the context it needs to answer questions, analyze data,
or perform tasks.

This is done in two primary ways: by referencing files and URIs using
standard Markdown links, and by executing shell commands with the `:cmd`
directive.

## Content References via Markdown Links

You can include local or remote content using the standard Markdown link
syntax, `[Title](URI)`. Lectic will fetch the content from the URI and
include it in the context for the LLM.

### Supported Content Types

- **Text**: Plain text files are included directly.
- **Images**: PNG, JPEG, GIF, and WebP images are supported.
- **PDFs**: Content from PDF files can be extracted (requires a provider that
  supports PDF ingestion, such as Anthropic, Gemini, or OpenAI).
- **Audio**: Gemini and OpenAI support audio inputs. For OpenAI, use
  `provider: openai/chat` with an audio‑capable model; supported formats
  include MP3, MPEG, and WAV. Gemini supports a broader set of audio types.
- **Video**: Gemini supports video understanding. See supported formats in
  Google’s docs:
  https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/video-understanding#supported-formats

### URI Schemes

Lectic supports several URI schemes for referencing content:

- **Local Files**: Simple relative paths like `./src/main.rs` or absolute
  `file:///path/to/file.txt` URIs.
- **Remote Content**: `http://` and `https://` for web pages and other
  online resources.
- **Amazon S3**: `s3://` for referencing objects in S3 buckets. This
  requires AWS credentials to be configured in your environment.
- **MCP Resources**: You can reference resources provided by an MCP server
  using a custom scheme, like `github+repo://...`, where `github` is the name
  of the MCP server (provided in the tool specification), and the rest is the
  resource URL.

A few convenience rules apply:

- For local file references using `file://`, use absolute paths. A
  portable way to build these is with `$PWD` (e.g.,
  `file://$PWD/papers/some.pdf`).
- Environment variables in URIs use the `$VAR` form; `${VAR}` is not
  supported. Expansion happens before any globbing.
- Environment variable expansion also applies to bare local paths (non‑URL
  links), such as `./$DATA_ROOT/file.txt`. Expansion happens before any
  globbing.

You can use glob patterns to include multiple files at once. This is useful
for providing the entire source code of a project as context.

```markdown
[All source code](./src/**/*.ts)
[All images in this directory](./images/*.jpg)
```

Lectic uses Bun's [Glob API](https://bun.sh/docs/api/glob) for matching.

### Advanced URI Features

Using full `file://` URIs for local content enables additional capabilities.

#### Environment Variable Expansion

Lectic supports environment variable expansion in URIs. This helps in
creating portable `.lec` files that don't rely on hardcoded absolute paths.

```markdown
[My dataset](file://$DATA_ROOT/my_project/data.csv)
[Log file](file://$PWD/logs/latest.log)
```

#### PDF Page Selection

When referencing a PDF, you can point to a specific page or a range of pages
by adding a fragment to the URI. Page numbering starts at 1.

- **Single Page**: `[See page 5](file.pdf#page=5)`
- **Page Range**: `[See Chapter 2](book.pdf#pages=20-35)`

If both `page` and `pages` are supplied, `pages` takes precedence. If a page
or range is malformed or out of bounds, Lectic will surface an error that is
visible to the LLM.

## Command Output via `:cmd` Directive

If you already have text you want to include verbatim (no command
execution), use `:attach[...]` instead.

Use `:cmd[...]` to execute a shell command and capture its stdout and stderr.
Lectic runs the command with the Bun shell. The result is returned as an
inline attachment that appears at the very top of the next assistant block.

How it works
- When you run lectic, any `:cmd[...]` found in the last user message is
  executed, and the result is forwarded to the LLM.
- The result is also inserted as an inline attachment chunk at the beginning of
  the generated assistant block. It looks like an XML block beginning with
  `<inline-attachment ...>`. It includes the command and its content (stdout,
  or an error wrapper that includes stdout and stderr).
- During provider serialization, this attachment is treated as if it were
  a user message that immediately precedes the assistant’s round. This keeps
  provider caches stable and avoids recomputing earlier commands.
- Older `:cmd[...]` directives are not re-executed. Their cached attachments
  remain part of the transcript and are reused across runs.

Use cases
- System information: `What can you tell me about my system? :cmd[uname -a]`
- Project state: `Write a commit message: :cmd[git diff --staged]`
- Data analysis: `Compute the average: :cmd[cat data.csv | awk '...']`

Notes
- Output is wrapped in XML. On success, stdout is included. On failure,
  an `<error>` wrapper includes both stdout and stderr.
- `:cmd` runs with Bun’s `$` shell in the current working directory. Standard
  Lectic environment variables like `LECTIC_FILE` are available. By contrast,
  single‑line `exec` tools run without a shell; invoke a shell explicitly if
  you need shell features.
- line breaks inside of `:cmd` are ignored so that if a `:cmd` happens to
  line-wrap, the newline doesn't affect the command to be executed.
