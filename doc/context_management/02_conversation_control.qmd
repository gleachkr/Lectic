# Managing Context: Conversation Control

Beyond simply adding external data, Lectic provides directives that allow you
to actively manage the flow of a conversation. You can switch between
different LLM interlocutors and control the context window that is sent to the
model.

## Multiparty Conversations with `:ask` and `:aside`

Lectic allows you to define multiple interlocutors in the YAML frontmatter.
This enables you to bring different "personalities" or models with different
capabilities into a single conversation.

To do this, use the `interlocutors` key (instead of `interlocutor`) and provide
a list of configurations.

```yaml
---
interlocutors:
  - name: Boggle
    provider: anthropic
    model: claude-sonnet-4-6
    prompt: You are an expert on personal finance.
  - name: Oggle
    provider: gemini
    prompt: You are very skeptical of conventional financial advice.
---
```

Once multiple interlocutors are defined, Lectic will continue with whichever
one was last active. To direct your message to a specific interlocutor, you
use the `:ask` and `:aside` directives.

### `:ask[Name]` - Permanently Switch Interlocutor

The `:ask[InterlocutorName]` directive changes the active speaker. All
subsequent conversation turns will be handled by this new interlocutor until
another `:ask` directive is used.

````markdown
:ask[Boggle] What is the best way to save for retirement?

:::Boggle
The most common advice is to invest in a diversified portfolio of low-cost
index funds.
:::

:ask[Oggle] What's your take on that?

:::Oggle
"Common advice" is often just dogma. That strategy leaves you completely
exposed to market downturns.
:::
````

### `:aside[Name]` - Switch for a Single Turn

The `:aside[InterlocutorName]` directive is for a one-off question or
comment. It directs the current message to the specified interlocutor, but the
conversation then reverts back to the previously active speaker for the
*next* user message.

This is useful for quick interjections or for getting a second opinion
without derailing the main flow of the conversation.

## Context Management with `:reset`

As a conversation grows longer, the context sent to the LLM on each turn also
grows. This can increase costs and, in some cases, lead to the model getting
"stuck" on earlier parts of the dialogue.

The `:reset[]` directive gives you manual control over the context window.
When Lectic processes a message containing `:reset[]`, it instructs the LLM
to **ignore all preceding conversation history**. The context for that turn
effectively begins with the message containing the directive.

````markdown
...a very long conversation happens here...

Okay, let's start fresh. I'm going to :reset[] your context now. Please
summarize our previous discussion and then we can move on to the next topic.

:::Assistant
Understood. I have cleared my context.

Previously, we discussed the history of the Roman Empire, focusing on the
reign of Augustus and the establishment of the Pax Romana. We concluded that
economic stability was a key factor in the era's success.

I am ready for the next topic.
:::

Excellent. Now, how did this conversation begin?

:::Assistant
This conversation began with you instructing me to reset my context and provide
a summary of our previous discussion about the Roman Empire.
:::
````

This is a powerful tool for managing long-running conversations, allowing you
to "compact" the context manually or with the help of the LLM.

## Dynamic Configuration with `:merge_yaml` and `:temp_merge_yaml`

Sometimes you need to change the configuration of the conversation on the fly.
Lectic provides two directives for this purpose, allowing you to merge new
YAML configuration into the header.

### `:merge_yaml[YAML]` - Permanently Update Configuration

The `:merge_yaml` directive allows you to permanently update the conversation's
configuration. The provided YAML is merged with the existing header, overriding
any existing keys.

```markdown
:merge_yaml[{ interlocutor: { model: "claude-opus-4-6" } }]
```

This change persists for all subsequent turns in the conversation.

### `:temp_merge_yaml[YAML]` - Temporarily Update Configuration

The `:temp_merge_yaml` directive updates the configuration for the *current turn
only*. This is useful for one-off changes, such as temporarily increasing the
`max_tokens` limit or enabling a specific tool.

```markdown
:temp_merge_yaml[{ interlocutor: { max_tokens: 4000 } }]
```

Once the turn is complete, the configuration reverts to its previous state for
subsequent messages.
