# External Prompts and Instructions

Many Lectic fields can load their text from outside the document. You can
point a field at a file on disk, or run a command (or script) and use its
output. This lets you keep prompts, usage text, and notes in one place, or
compute them on demand.

What supports external sources:

- interlocutor.prompt
- macros[].expansion
- tools[].usage (for tools that accept a usage string)
- tools[].details (for tools that provide extra details)
- tools[].init_sql (for sqlite tool initialization SQL)
- interlocutor.output_schema

Each of these accepts either a plain string, or a string beginning with one
of the prefixes below.

For `interlocutor.output_schema`, loaded content is parsed as YAML (so JSON
files are valid too) and then validated as a JSON Schema.

## `file:PATH`

Loads the contents of PATH and uses that as the field value. Environment
variables in the path are expanded before reading.

Examples

```yaml
interlocutor:
  name: Assistant
  prompt: file:./prompts/assistant.md
```

```yaml
macros:
  - name: summarize
    expansion: file:$HOME/.config/lectic/prompts/summarize.txt
```

## `local:PATH` and `file:local:PATH`

Use `local:` when a path should be resolved relative to the config source
file that contains the value.

Supported forms:

- `local:./...`
- `local:../...`
- `file:local:./...`
- `file:local:../...`

Not supported:

- `local:file:...`
- `local:exec:...`
- `local:/abs/path`
- `local:foo/bar` (must start with `./` or `../`)

`local:` rewrites to an absolute filesystem path string.
`file:local:` rewrites to `file:/absolute/path`.

Example:

```yaml
tools:
  - exec: bash
    env:
      PLUGIN_ROOT: local:./
      PROMPT_FILE: local:./prompts/review.md

interlocutor:
  prompt: file:$PROMPT_FILE
  # or directly:
  # prompt: file:local:./prompts/review.md
```

## `exec:COMMAND` or `exec:SCRIPT`

Runs the command and uses its stdout as the field value. There are two
forms:

- Single line: executed directly, not through a shell. Shell features like
  globbing and command substitution do not work. If you need them, invoke a
  shell explicitly (for example, `bash -lc '...'`).
- Multi‑line: treated as a script. The first line must be a shebang (for
  example, `#!/usr/bin/env bash`). The script is written to a temporary file
  and executed with the interpreter from the shebang.

Environment variables in a single‑line command are expanded before running.
For multi‑line scripts, variables are available via the process environment
at runtime.

## Examples

Single line

```yaml
interlocutor:
  name: Assistant
  prompt: exec:echo "You are a helpful assistant."
```

Multi‑line script

```yaml
interlocutor:
  name: Assistant
  prompt: |
    exec:#!/usr/bin/env bash
    cat <<'PREFACE'
    You are a helpful assistant.
    You will incorporate recent memory below.
    PREFACE
    echo
    echo "Recent memory:"
    sqlite3 "$LECTIC_DATA/memory.sqlite3" \
      "SELECT printf('- %s (%s)', text, ts) FROM memory \
       ORDER BY ts DESC LIMIT 5;"
```

## Working directory and environment

- `file:` and `exec:` resolve relative paths and run commands in the current
  working directory of the lectic process (the directory from which you
  invoked the command). If you used -f or -i, note that the working
  directory does not automatically switch to the .lec file's directory for
  these expansions. Use absolute paths or cd if you need a different base.
- `local:` is the exception: it is resolved relative to the config source
  file where it appears, then rewritten to an absolute path.
- Standard Lectic environment variables are provided, including
  `LECTIC_CONFIG`, `LECTIC_DATA`, `LECTIC_CACHE`, `LECTIC_STATE`, `LECTIC_TEMP`, and
  `LECTIC_FILE` (when using `-f` or `-i`). Your shell environment is also passed
  through.
- Macro expansions can inject additional variables into `exec:` via directive
  attributes. See the [Macros guide](../automation/01_macros.qmd) for details.

## Behavior and errors

- The value is recomputed on each run. This makes it easy to incorporate
  recent state (for example, "memory" from a local database) into a prompt.
- If a file cannot be read or a command fails, Lectic reports an error and
  aborts the run. Fix the source and try again.
