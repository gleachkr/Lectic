# Recipe: Research with Multiple Perspectives

This recipe shows how to use multiple interlocutors to explore a topic
from different angles. One interlocutor does research, another provides
critique, and you can quickly get second opinions without derailing the
main conversation.

## The Setup

```yaml
---
interlocutors:
  - name: Researcher
    prompt: |
      You are a thorough researcher. When exploring a topic:
      - Consider multiple sources and viewpoints
      - Note uncertainties and limitations
      - Suggest follow-up questions
    provider: anthropic
    model: claude-sonnet-4-20250514
    tools:
      - native: search
      - think_about: >
          What are the key questions here? What might I be missing?
          What assumptions am I making?

  - name: Critic  
    prompt: |
      You are a skeptical critic. Your job is to:
      - Challenge assumptions and weak arguments
      - Point out missing evidence or alternative explanations
      - Steelman opposing viewpoints
      Be constructive but rigorous.
    provider: anthropic
    model: claude-sonnet-4-20250514

  - name: Synthesizer
    prompt: |
      You synthesize discussions into clear summaries. Focus on:
      - Key points of agreement and disagreement
      - Open questions that remain
      - Actionable conclusions

```

## Usage

### Start with research

```markdown
:ask[Researcher] I'm trying to understand the tradeoffs between
microservices and monolithic architectures for a team of 5 developers
building a B2B SaaS product.
```

The Researcher will explore the topic, potentially using web search and
their thinking tool.

### Get a quick critique

Use `:aside` to get feedback without switching the main conversation:

```markdown
:aside[Critic] What's wrong with this analysis?
```

The Critic responds, then the next message goes back to the Researcher
automatically.

### Permanently switch for deeper critique

```markdown
:ask[Critic] Let's dig into the claim about "complexity tax." What's
the actual evidence here?
```

Now you're in a conversation with the Critic until you switch again.

### Synthesize at the end

```markdown
:ask[Synthesizer] Summarize this discussion. What did we learn? What
should we do next?
```

## Variations

### Domain-specific experts

```yaml
interlocutors:
  - name: Legal
    prompt: You are a legal expert. Focus on regulatory compliance...
  - name: Technical
    prompt: You are a senior engineer. Focus on implementation...
  - name: Business
    prompt: You are a business strategist. Focus on market fit...
```

### Agent delegation

Have one interlocutor call another as a tool:

```yaml
interlocutors:
  - name: Lead
    prompt: You coordinate research. Delegate to specialists.
    tools:
      - agent: Researcher
        name: research
        usage: Get detailed research on a specific topic.
      - agent: Critic
        name: critique
        usage: Get critical analysis of a claim or argument.
  
  - name: Researcher
    prompt: ...
    tools:
      - native: search
  
  - name: Critic
    prompt: ...
```

Now the Lead can autonomously decide when to delegate:

```markdown
:ask[Lead] Evaluate whether we should migrate from PostgreSQL to
CockroachDB for our multi-region deployment.
```

### Different models for different roles

Use cheaper/faster models for quick checks:

```yaml
interlocutors:
  - name: Deep
    model: claude-sonnet-4-20250514  # For complex analysis
    
  - name: Quick
    model: claude-3-haiku-20240307  # For quick sanity checks
```

## Tips

- **Use `:aside` liberally.** It's cheap to get a second opinion without
  losing your place in the main conversation.

- **Give each interlocutor a distinct voice.** The prompts should produce
  noticeably different responses, otherwise there's no point in having
  multiple speakers.

- **Use `:reset[]` when switching topics.** If you're starting a new line
  of inquiry, reset context to avoid confusion from earlier discussion.
