# Cookbook

This section contains practical recipes showing how to combine Lectic's
primitives to build useful workflows. Each recipe is self-contained and
can be adapted to your needs.

## Recipes

- [Coding Assistant](./01_coding_assistant.qmd): An agentic setup with
  shell tools, TypeScript checking, and human-in-the-loop confirmation.
- [Git Commit Messages](./02_commit_messages.qmd): A custom subcommand
  that generates commit messages from staged changes.
- [Research with Multiple Perspectives](./03_research_perspectives.qmd):
  Using multiple interlocutors to get different viewpoints on a problem.
- [Conversation Memory](./04_memory.qmd): Persisting conversations to
  SQLite and retrieving relevant context.
- [Context Compaction](./05_context_compaction.qmd): Automatically
  summarizing and resetting context when token limits approach.
- [Custom Sandboxing](./06_custom_sandboxing.qmd): Isolate tool execution
  using wrapper scripts like Bubblewrap.
- [Control Flow with Macros](./07_control_flow_macros.qmd): Implement advanced
  logic like loops, conditionals, and maps using recursive macros.
- [Agent Skills Support](./08_skills_subcommand.qmd): Expose Agent Skills as a
  progressive-disclosure tool that can load instructions, references, and run
  skill scripts.
