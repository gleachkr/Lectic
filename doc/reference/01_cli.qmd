# Reference: Command‑Line Interface

The `lectic` command is the primary way to interact with Lectic. It can read
from a file or from standard input, and it offers flags to control how the
result is printed or saved.

## Usage

```bash
lectic [FLAGS] [OPTIONS] [SUBCOMMAND] [ARGS...]
```

## Subcommands

- `lectic lsp`
  Start the LSP server. Transport: stdio.

- `lectic parse`
  Parse a lectic file into a JSON representation of the parsed file
  structure. Useful for programmatic analysis and modification.

  Flags:
  - `--yaml`: Emit YAML instead of JSON.
  - `--reverse`: Ingest JSON (or YAML) output and reconstruct the original
    lectic file.

- `lectic models`
  List available models for providers with detected credentials.

  Providers with API keys in the environment are queried. The `chatgpt`
  provider is listed if you have previously logged in (it is not an API
  key-based provider).

- `lectic script`
  Run an ES module file using Lectic's internal Bun JS runtime. Works as
  a hashbang interpreter, useful for writing subcommands (see below),
  [hooks](../automation/02_hooks.qmd), and [exec tools](../tools/02_exec.qmd).
  For example:

  ```bash
  #!/bin/env -S lectic script
  console.log("Hello from a lectic script!")
  ```

- `lectic a2a`
  Start an A2A (JSON-RPC + SSE) server exposing configured agents.

  Options:
  - `--root <path>`: Workspace root (process.chdir to this path).
  - `--host <host>`: Bind host. Default: `127.0.0.1`.
  - `--port <port>`: Bind port. Default: `41240`.
  - `--token <token>`: If set, require `Authorization: Bearer <token>`.
  - `--max-tasks-per-context <n>`: Maximum number of task snapshots to
    keep in memory per contextId. Default: `50`.

## Custom Subcommands

Lectic supports git-style custom subcommands. If you invoke
`lectic <command>`, Lectic will look for an executable named
`lectic-<command>` in your
configuration directory, data directory, or PATH.

See [Custom Subcommands](../automation/03_custom_subcommands.qmd) for a full
guide on creating subcommands and adding tab completion for them.

## Bash completion

The repository includes a bash completion script. See
[Getting Started](../02_getting_started.qmd#tab-completion-optional) for
installation instructions.

The completion system is extensible. You can write plugins to provide
completions for your custom subcommands. See the
[Custom Subcommands](../automation/03_custom_subcommands.qmd#tab-completion)
guide for details.

## Flags and options

- `-v`, `--version`
  Prints the version string.

- `-f`, `--file <PATH>`
  Path to the conversation file (`.lec`) to process. If omitted, Lectic
  reads from standard input.

- `-i`, `--inplace <PATH>`
  Read from the given file and update it in place. Mutually exclusive with
  `--file`.

- `-s`, `--short`
  Only emit the newly generated assistant message, not the full updated
  conversation.

- `-S`, `--Short`
  Like `--short`, but emits only the raw message text (without the
  `:::Speaker` wrapper).

- `-l`, `--log <PATH>`
  Write detailed debug logs to the given file.

- `-q`, `--quiet`
  Suppress printing the assistant's response to stdout.

- `-h`, `--help`
  Show help for all flags and options.

## Constraints

- --inplace cannot be combined with --file.
- --quiet cannot be combined with --short or --Short.

## Common examples

- Generate the next message in a file and update it in place:
  ```bash
  lectic -i conversation.lec
  ```

- Read from stdin and write the full result to stdout:
  ```bash
  cat conversation.lec | lectic
  ```

- Stream just the new assistant message:
  ```bash
  lectic -s -f conversation.lec
  ```

- Add a message from the command line and update the file:
  ```bash
  echo "This is a new message." | lectic -i conversation.lec
  ```

- List available models for detected providers:
  ```bash
  lectic models
  ```

- Start the LSP server (stdio transport):
  ```bash
  lectic lsp
  ```

- Parse a file to JSON:
  ```bash
  lectic parse -f conversation.lec
  ```

- Round-trip a file through parsing and reconstruction:
  ```bash
  lectic parse -f conversation.lec | lectic parse --reverse
  ```
