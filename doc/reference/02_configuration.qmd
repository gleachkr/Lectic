# Reference: Configuration Keys

This document provides a reference for all the keys available in Lectic's
YAML configuration, including the main `.lec` file frontmatter and any
included configuration files.

## Top-Level Keys

- `interlocutor`: A single object defining the primary LLM speaker.
- `interlocutors`: A list of interlocutor objects for multiparty
  conversations.
- `macros`: A list of macro definitions. See [Macros](../automation/01_macros.qmd).
- `hooks`: A list of hook definitions. See [Hooks](../automation/02_hooks.qmd).

---

## The `interlocutor` Object

An interlocutor object defines a single LLM "personality" or configuration.

- `name`: (Required) The name of the speaker, used in the `:::Name`
  response blocks.
- `prompt`: (Required) The base system prompt that defines the LLM's
  personality and instructions. The value can be a string, or it can be
  loaded from a file (`file:./path.txt`) or a command (`exec:get-prompt`).

### Model Configuration

- `provider`: The LLM provider to use. Examples: `anthropic`, `openai`,
  `gemini`, `ollama`, `openrouter`. Defaults to the first available API key
  found in the environment.
- `model`: The specific model to use, e.g., `claude-3-opus-20240229`.
- `temperature`: A number between 0 and 1 controlling the randomness of the
  output.
- `max_tokens`: The maximum number of tokens to generate in a response.
- `max_tool_use`: The maximum number of tool calls the LLM is allowed to make
  in a single turn.

### Context Management

- `reminder`: A string that is invisibly added to the user's message on
  every turn. Useful for reinforcing key instructions without cluttering the
  conversation history.

### Tools

- `tools`: A list of tool definitions that this interlocutor can use. The
  format of each object in the list depends on the tool type. See the
  [Tools section](../tools/) for detailed configuration guides for each tool.

## The `macro` Object

- `name`: (Required) The name of the macro, used when invoking it with
  `:macro[name]`.
- `expansion`: (Required) The content to be expanded. Can be a string, or
  loaded via `file:` or `exec:`.

---

## The `hook` Object

- `on`: (Required) A single event name or a list of event names to trigger
  the hook. Supported events are `user_message`, `assistant_message`, and
  `error`.
- `do`: (Required) The command or inline script to run when the event
  occurs. If multiâ€‘line, it must start with a shebang (e.g., `#!/bin/bash`).
  Event context is provided as environment variables. See the Hooks guide
  for details.
