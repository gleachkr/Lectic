title: LSP Server (Experimental)
---

Lectic includes a small Language Server Protocol (LSP) server that
provides completion for directives and macros, plus hovers. It is stdio
only.

Overview
- Command: `lectic lsp`
- Transport: stdio (no `--node-ipc` or `--socket`)
- Features: `textDocument/completion`, `textDocument/hover`,
  diagnostics, document symbols (outline), folding ranges,
  go to definition
- Triggers: `:` and `[` inside directive brackets
- Insertions
  - Directives use snippets and place the cursor inside brackets (or at
    the end for reset):
    `:cmd[${0:command}]`, `:ask[$0]`,
    `:aside[$0]`, `:macro[$0]`, `:reset[]$0`.
  - Inside brackets of `:ask[...]` and `:aside[...]`, only interlocutor
    names are offered. Inside `:macro[...]`, only macro names are
    offered.
- Matching: case‑insensitive; typed prefix after `:` or inside `[` is
  respected.
- Fences: no suggestions inside `::` or `:::` runs
- Trigger filtering: only `:ask[`/`:aside[`/`:macro[` produce bracket
  completions

Where completions come from
- Directives: built‑in suggestions for `:cmd`, `:ask`, `:aside`,
  `:macro`, and `:reset`.
- Macros: merged from the same places and precedence as the CLI (higher
  wins):
  1) System config: `${LECTIC_CONFIG}/lectic.yaml`
  2) Workspace config: `lectic.yaml` in the document directory
  3) The document’s YAML header
- Interlocutors: collected from the merged header as above, combining
  `interlocutor` and `interlocutors`.
- De‑duplication is case‑insensitive on name. Higher‑precedence entry
  wins.
- The server shows a simple preview in the completion item.

Behavior examples
- Type `:` → suggestions for directives.
- Type `:ma` → `macro` appears and inserts `:macro[$0]`.
- Type `:macro[` → invoke completion to see macro names; select one to
  fill the bracket content.
- Type `:ask[` or `:aside[` → invoke completion to see interlocutor
  names; selecting a name replaces only the text inside the `[`...`]`.
- Type `::` or `:::` → no suggestions (reserved for directive fences).
- Place the cursor inside `:macro[name]` or `:ask[Name]` and invoke
  “Go to Definition” to jump to the YAML name in the document header.
  If not present locally, the LSP will jump to the name in the nearest
  config (`lectic.yaml` in the document directory, then the system
  config).

Neovim setup (vim.lsp.start)
- Minimal startup for the current buffer:

```lua
local client_id = vim.lsp.start({
  name = "lectic",
  cmd = { "lectic", "lsp" },
  root_dir = vim.fs.root(0, { ".git", "lectic.yaml" })
             or vim.fn.getcwd(),
  single_file_support = true,
})
```

- Auto‑start for `.lec` (and optionally markdown) files:

```lua
vim.api.nvim_create_autocmd("FileType", {
  pattern = { "lectic", "markdown.lectic", "lectic.markdown" },
  callback = function(args)
    vim.lsp.start({
      name = "lectic",
      cmd = { "lectic", "lsp" },
      root_dir = vim.fs.root(args.buf, { ".git", "lectic.yaml" })
                 or vim.fn.getcwd(),
      single_file_support = true,
    })
  end,
})
```

- Using completion
  - With nvim‑cmp (recommended), LSP completion should pop on `:`.
  - Inside brackets, invoke completion manually (`Ctrl‑x Ctrl‑o`) if your
    setup is not configured to trigger automatically.

- Troubleshooting
  - Ensure `lectic` is on PATH inside Neovim.
  - Ensure the buffer contains macros in the header or that a
    `lectic.yaml` is present in the working root.
  - Completion is only offered on a single `:` (not `::` or `:::`).

VS Code setup
- The server is an external stdio LSP. You can connect to it from a
  VS Code extension. The repository includes `extra/lectic.vscode` for a
  ready‑made extension.
- Minimal client snippet (TypeScript) for an extension:

```ts
import * as vscode from 'vscode'
import { LanguageClient, TransportKind } from 'vscode-languageclient/node'

let client: LanguageClient
export function activate(context: vscode.ExtensionContext) {
  const serverOptions = {
    command: 'lectic',
    args: ['lsp'],
    options: { stdio: 'pipe' } // stdio only
  }
  const clientOptions = {
    documentSelector: [ { scheme: 'file', language: 'markdown' },
                        { scheme: 'file', pattern: '**/*.lec' } ],
  }
  client = new LanguageClient(
    'lectic', 'Lectic LSP', serverOptions as any, clientOptions
  )
  context.subscriptions.push(client.start())
}
```

Diagnostics
- The server publishes diagnostics on open/change.
- Duplicate names in the document header are warned with precise ranges.
  Later entries win at runtime; the warning helps catch mistakes.
- Duplicates originating only from included configs may be reported with
  a coarse header-range warning.

Document symbols (outline)
- The outline shows a "Header" section with "Interlocutors" and
  "Macros" (local definitions only), and a "Body" section with user
  chunks and assistant blocks (e.g., "Assistant: Name").
- Included items from workspace/system configs do not appear in the
  current document’s symbols.

Folding
- The LSP provides folding ranges for tool‑call blocks only. A block
  must be a serialized `<tool-call ...> ... </tool-call>` that appears
  as a direct child of an interlocutor container directive (`:::Name`).
- The folded range includes both the opening and closing tags. The
  entire block is concealed when folded. The opening tag may be
  indented; fenced code blocks are always ignored.
- Editing or completions inside tool‑call XML are not provided.
- Client behavior:
  - Neovim: set `foldexpr=vim.lsp.foldexpr()` to use LSP folding.
  - VS Code: the bundled extension defers folding to the LSP and does
    not register its own folding provider.

Hovers
- Hover over a directive (e.g., `:ask[...]`) to see a short description.
- Hover over a link destination to see the normalized absolute path. For
  local text files, a small preview of the file head is shown. For
  remote URLs, directories, missing files, non‑text files, or empty
  files, the hover explains why no preview is available.

Diagnostics
- Link diagnostics surface local filesystem issues:
  - Missing path
  - Empty glob pattern
  - file:// URLs must be absolute (use file://$PWD/... or file:///...)
- Diagnostics are published on open and debounced during edits to reduce
  churn while streaming.

Architecture
- The LSP parses markdown in a background worker. For each (uri,version),
  the worker builds a compact “analysis bundle” and posts results in
  order: folding ranges → bundle → diagnostics.
- The server caches the bundle and waits for the current one before
  answering completions, hovers, symbols, and code actions. Folding
  already waits and remains first for UX.
- No feature re‑parses markdown on the main thread. Unit tests build a
  minimal bundle fixture instead of using ad‑hoc string scans.

Notes
- Completion previews are static; the server does not expand macros or
  read files referenced by `file:`.
