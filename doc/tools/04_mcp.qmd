# Tools: Model Context Protocol (`mcp`)

Lectic can act as a client for servers that implement the [Model Context
Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io). This allows you to connect
your LLM to a vast and growing ecosystem of pre-built tools and services.

You can find lists of available servers here:
- [Official MCP Server List](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers)
- [Awesome MCP Servers](https://github.com/punkpeye/awesome-mcp-servers)

## Configuration

Note: The snippets below show only the tool definition. They assume you have
an interlocutor with a valid prompt and model configuration. See Getting
Started for a full header example.

You can connect to an MCP server in three ways: by running a local server as
a command, or by connecting to a remote server over WebSockets or SSE.

### Local MCP Server (`mcp_command`)

This is the most common way to run an MCP server. You provide the command
to start the server, and Lectic manages its lifecycle.

```yaml
tools:
  - name: brave
    mcp_command: npx
    args:
      - "-y"
      - "@modelcontextprotocol/server-brave-search"
    env:
      BRAVE_API_KEY: "your_key_here"
    roots:
      - /home/user/research-docs/
```

Local MCP servers are started on demand for the active interlocutor and
managed by Lectic for the duration of the session.

### Remote MCP Servers

You can also connect to running MCP servers.

- `mcp_ws`: The URL for a remote server using a WebSocket connection.
- `mcp_sse`: The URL for a remote server using Server-Sent Events.
- `mcp_shttp`: The URL for a remote server using Streamable HTTP.

For example:
```yaml
tools:
  - name: documentation_search 
    mcp_shttp: https://mcp.context7.com/mcp
```

### Server Resources and Content References

If you give an MCP tool a `name` (e.g., `name: brave`), you can access any
[resources](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/concepts/resources) it
provides using a special content reference syntax. The scheme is the server's
name plus the resource type.

For example, to access a `repo` resource from a server named `github`:
`[README](github+repo://gleachkr/Lectic/contents/README.md)`

The LLM is also given a tool to list the available resources from the server.

### Excluding server tools

You can hide specific tools that a server exposes by listing their names
under `exclude`. 

```yaml
tools:
  - name: github
    mcp_ws: wss://example.org/mcp
    exclude:
      - dangerous_tool
      - low_value_tool
```

## Safety and trust

::: {.callout-warning}

While powerful, the MCP protocol carries significant security risks. Treat
MCP integration as a high-trust capability. Never connect to untrusted
servers; a malicious server could exfiltrate data or perform unwanted
actions. Lectic’s safety mechanisms reduce mistakes from a well‑behaved
LLM, not attacks from a hostile server.

### Confirmation via hooks

Just like with the `exec` tool, you can use the `tool_use_pre` hook to implement
confirmation dialogs or logic. See [Hooks](../automation/02_hooks.qmd) for examples.

### Sandboxing (`sandbox`)

For local `mcp_command` tools, you can specify a `sandbox` command. This
command will be used to launch the MCP server process in a controlled and
isolated environment, limiting its access to your system. Arguments are
supported (e.g. `sandbox: wrapper.sh --strict`).

See the documentation for the [Exec Tool](./02_exec.qmd) for more details on
how sandboxing scripts work, and the
[Custom Sandboxing](../cookbook/06_custom_sandboxing.qmd) recipe for
examples.

You can also set a default `sandbox` on the `interlocutor` object. If set,
it applies to all local MCP tools that don't specify their own.
