# Other Tools: `think` and `native`

This document covers two tool types: a cognitive scratchpad for the LLM,
and provider-native tools like web search or code execution.

`serve_on_port` is no longer a built-in tool. If you want browser previews,
use a skill-based replacement. A bundled example lives at
`extra/skills/serve`.

## The `think` Tool

The `think` tool gives the LLM a private "scratch space" to pause and
reason about a prompt before formulating its final response. This can
improve the quality and thoughtfulness of the output, especially for
complex or ambiguous questions.

This technique was inspired by a post on [Anthropic's engineering
blog](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/claude-think-tool). The output
of the `think` tool is hidden from the user by default in the editor
plugins, though it is still present in the `.lec` file.

### Configuration

```yaml
tools:
  - think_about: >
      What the user is really asking for, and what hidden assumptions they
      might have.
    name: scratchpad # Optional name
```

### Example

```markdown
What's the best city in the world?

:::Assistant

<tool-call with="scratchpad">
<arguments>
<thought>
┆"Best" is subjective. The user could mean best for travel, for
┆food, for work, etc. I need to ask for clarification.
</thought>
</arguments>
<results>
<result type="text">
┆thought complete.
</result>
</results>
</tool-call>

That depends on what you're looking for! Are you interested in the best
city for tourism, career opportunities, or something else?

## `native` Tools

Native tools allow you to access functionality that is built directly into
the LLM provider's backend, such as web search or a code interpreter
environment for data analysis.

Support for native tools varies by provider.

### Configuration

You enable native tools by specifying their type.

```yaml
tools:
  - native: search # Enable the provider's built-in web search.
  - native: code   # Enable the provider's built-in code interpreter.
```

### Provider Support

- **Gemini**: Supports both `search` and `code`. Note that the Gemini API
  has a limitation where you can only use one native tool at a time, and
  it cannot be combined with other (non-native) tools.
- **Anthropic**: Supports `search` only.
- **OpenAI**: Supports both `search` and `code` via the `openai` provider
  (not the legacy `openai/chat` provider).
- **Codex**: Supports both `search` and `code` via the `codex` provider
  (ChatGPT subscription, Codex backend).
